Warm up task:
    1. Wash your hand
    2. write a program that can display the days based on the numbers 1 ~ 7
            MUST USE NESTED IF
            precondition: valid number for the day
    3. write a java program that can convert numbers between 0 ~ 9 to words, if the number is greater than 9 or less than zero, out put should be "Invalid".
                DO NOT USE IF STATEMENTS
    4. write a program that can find the number of days in a month
        (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
                28 days: 2
                30 days: 4,6, 9, 11
                31 days: 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
            MUST USE NESTED IF
Switch statement:

    syntax:
        switch(expression){
            case  caseValue1:
                        statement;
                        break;
            case  caseValue2:
                        statement;
                        break;
            case  caseValue3:
                        statement;
                        break;
            default:
                statement;
                break;
        }
        switch statement' expression cannot be boolean
        caseValues MUST be matching with the switch statement's expressions
        caseValue MUST be unique
        default: gets executed if none of case are matching
        break statement: used for exiting the switch statement' block
        if we do not give break statement, then the next available code fragments in switch will be executed
